# CHROME EXTENSION - De-Visibility

## About
This chrome extension is a small add-on that, on almost all webpages, changes the saturation level to 550%. 
This is a work-in-progress, and the goal in the future is to add an adjustable slider that allows the user to change the saturation in a range from 0% to 1000%. I am looking towards a js/jQuery only solution for that. 
The idea behind this extension is to alter the way user view their sites, and maybe just bring them a little fun if they find it funny.
I'm glad to report it wokrs on google maps.

### Influence
The main inspiration I got for this were the "deep-fried memes" that keep showing up on my social media randomly.
